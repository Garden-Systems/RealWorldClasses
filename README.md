# RealWorldClasses
Repo for classes of real world

# Introduction 
This project was started in lieu of the demand of automating the real world objects in the IT industry. We know and live around a tons of objects arond us. Having to write these objects in our classes posses a real constraint in terms of the time spent and the accuracy of the data. This repository can help hundreds or thousands of developers writing such classes in their work. These classes can be used in industries such as Gaming, Virtual Reality, Animation movies and so on

Currently the classes are written in C#, as contributors increase, we can have support for other languages as well.
